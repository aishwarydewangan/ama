# aishwr/ama

A repository to ask [@aishwr](https://github.com/aishwr) anything.

### Ask a question

Asking a question is as easy as creating a [new issue](https://github.com/aishwr/ama/issues/new) on this project.

I'll try to answer it as soon as I can get to it. Once I answer I'll close the issue, but don't worry- if you have any 
further questions just respond in the thread and I'll get back to you soon. Feel free to ask a question on any old 
issue too, even if you didn't create it.

### Twitter

If you have something quick and easy, you can also ping me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/_aishwr_).
